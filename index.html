            <p>Travelling is such a wonderful opportunity, and being able to travel on a budget makes it more
                accessible to people. Also, if you spend less on one adventure, you have money to spend on
                another. Budget travel doesn’t have to be any less fun either. There are cheap places to travel
                to all over the world

        <h1>Travelling Post Covid-19 Pandemic</h1>
<p class="">After the numerous lockdowns and border closures of 2020, people all over the world are dying 
    to get out and travel. We’ve all spent so much time stuck at home, reading, watching movies, and 
    scanning social media, intrigued by photos and videos of beautiful, far-off places. Seasoned travelers
     like myself are itching to book a flight somewhere as soon as borders re-open. And there are plenty 
     of novice travelers who have never felt more inspired to go see the world. Lots of people are trying 
     to get back on their feet financially. Luckily, traveling the world can be insanely cheap if you 
     visit the right places! There are lots of gorgeous destinations in the world that make excellent 
     vacations, but they don’t cost a fortune to visit.  </p>
